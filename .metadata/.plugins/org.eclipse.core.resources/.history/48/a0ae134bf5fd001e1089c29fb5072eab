	 Lombok is a Java library that provides annotations to simplify Java development by 
	automating the generation of boilerplate code. Key features include automatic generation 
	of getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods, as well as a facility 
	for automatic resource management. It aims to reduce the amount of manual coding, 
	thereby streamlining the codebase and reducing potential for errors. */
